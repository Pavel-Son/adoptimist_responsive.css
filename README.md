Hello!
I'm using Chrome plugin "Stylish" to connect external css to web-site. 
You need to: 
1. download and install Stylish.
2. Right click to Stylish icon on toolbar.
3. Press settings.
4. Then create the style.
5. Call it for example 'adoptimist.css', it's doesn't realy matter
6. In the right textarea you need to paste code. Copy code from here.
https://github.com/StanleeLOD/adoptimist_responsive.css/blob/master/responsive.css .
7. Press "save" and refresh page with open web-site. 
8. I'm keep write the code, so if you need to refresh it- then left click in Stylish icon in toolbar, select your style and click "change", then paste new code and click "save".
